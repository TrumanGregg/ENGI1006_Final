Assignment: Final Project

Brief Summary:
	The goal of this assignment was to use Flask with Python to create a local 
	"server" with a number of routes directing both users and data to and form 
	various pages on a website. We were also asked to use and create a Git 
	repository containing a folder with all of our files. I meet the expecatations
	for this final project by filling my three "website pages" with the content 
	requested. Also, I added CSS to style the webpages and included a cool image
	as the background for each of the three websites.
